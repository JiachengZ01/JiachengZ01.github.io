Hi there, I am Jiacheng (James) Zhang. I am a research intern in the TikTok Data Trust & Safety team, mentored by [Dr Haoyu He](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haoyu-he-527526161/?originalSubdomain=au), and a Ph.D. candidate at [Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR)](https://github.com/tmlr-group) group in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, the University of Melbourne under the supervision of [Dr. Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/) and [Prof. Ben Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net/). Previously, I was an associate member of [Sea AI Lab (SAIL)](https://sail.sea.com/), mentored by [Dr. Tianyu Pang](https://p2333.github.io/) and [Dr. Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/). I received my Honours degree with a University Medal (**Top 1** in my major) from the University of Sydney, where I was fortunate to learn from [A/Prof. Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io/). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Melbourne.

I am passionate about advancing the field of **trustworthy machine learning**, with a long-term vision of enabling **safe, reliable, and ethically aligned AI systems** that can be responsibly deployed in real-world environments. My current research interests lie in improving the **robustness** and **safety** of AI systems at multiple levels, including but not limited to: (1) safety alignment for multimodal AI agents; (2) safety alignment for large vision-language models; (3) adversarial robustness for vision models.

In an era where AI systems are increasingly embedded in high-stakes, real-world decision-making domains, I firmly believe that their foundations must be trustworthy and safe: not as an afterthought, but as a prerequisite for responsible and sustainable societal integration.

*Please feel free to email me for research, collaborations, or a casual chat.*
